Comusic is my most ambitious project, born from a big love for music and technology. Nearly five years ago, I had the idea of a collaborative space for musicians to share, contribute, and co-create. With the advent of blockchain technology, I found the perfect avenue to turn this vision into a reality.

Creating a token-gated music NFT platform was the perfect opportunity for me to learn JavaScript, React and Solidity.

Starting from scratch I built Comusic, shaping it to resemble a simple digital audio workstation. Along the way, I had to learn how to make an audio player capable of playing multiple tracks simultaneously, with pan and volume controls.

Teaming up with local musicians, I created a live prototype and decided to use a SQL database to ensure the site's functionality. Choosing to build the foundation with a regular database, leaving room for blockchain integration in the future.

Comusic has grown into a collective of like-minded artists, supporting emerging musicians in the Web3 space. Our roadmap includes exciting prospects like a marketplace for music NFTs and a service platform for music-related needs. The journey continues!


You can check the progress on [comusic.io](http://www.comusic.io)


Over the past four years, I have dedicated myself to a range of personal projects, developing my skills in design, CSS, JavaScript, and Solidity. I enjoy studying these areas and launching my own ideas. This collection showcases my work, from UI designs to complex blockchain applications.



## Comusic

Comusic is an app that enables musicians to collaborate with the community by sending pieces of music and composing together. When you upload your audio, you receive an NFT that proves your ownership and role in the composition.

The app uses recent wallet abstraction methods to enhance accessibility for non-crypto users.
