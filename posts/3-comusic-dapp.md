Comusic is my most ambitious project, born from a big love for music and technology. Nearly five years ago, I had the idea of a collaborative space for musicians to share, contribute, and co-create. With the advent of blockchain technology, I found the perfect avenue to turn this vision into a reality.

Creating a token-gated music NFT platform was the perfect opportunity for me to learn JavaScript, React and Solidity.

Starting from scratch I built Comusic, shaping it to resemble a simple digital audio workstation. Along the way, I had to learn how to make an audio player capable of playing multiple tracks simultaneously, with pan and volume controls.

Teaming up with local musicians, I created a live prototype and decided to use a SQL database to ensure the site's functionality. Choosing to build the foundation with a regular database, leaving room for blockchain integration in the future.

Comusic has grown into a collective of like-minded artists, supporting emerging musicians in the Web3 space. Our roadmap includes exciting prospects like a marketplace for music NFTs and a service platform for music-related needs. The journey continues!
