As I delved into Comusic's development, my passion for blockchain technology drove me to explore more possibilities. I decided to learn how to create and deploy contracts on the blockchain.

During my first sprint, I dedicated time to learn the fundamentals of token creation, using OpenZeppelin and similar libraries. I learned how to create tokens and deploy them on Pulsechain's testnet and mainnet. I also explored liquidity provision on PulseX and worked to ensure the security of the meme coin I created.

Later, I was able to create more complex smart contracts, including a Staking contract. This experience allowed me to learn tools like Truffle and Remix.
