ISTU, a lively t-shirt store filled with original designs, came to life through a collaborative effort between me and the talented artist, Milena. From crafting captivating illustrations to designing the user interface, we poured our creative energy into every aspect of this artistic venture.

Despite the undeniable appeal of our uniquely crafted designs, ISTU's sales have not reached the heights we envisioned. Nevertheless, the journey has been a valuable experience as we ventured into building the shop and creating hundreds of illustrations.
