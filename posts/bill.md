In my early days in the crypto world, I invested in a project called "YFKA - Yield farming know as Ash" without fully understanding the risks. Unfortunately, I faced losses, but this setback became a turning point.

To recover my investment, I took the initiative and created a new design for YFKA website. This effort brought the community together, and we worked hand in hand to reignite the project's momentum.

After that the community entrusted me with improving the websites for Bill's other projects: [*Atiample*](http://103.89.12.183/portfolio/xamp/)  and [*Tokens of Babel*](http://103.89.12.183/portfolio/tob/). 
<br/><small>(For archival purposes, I hosted those sites on my remote server. Check them on the links)</small>

These seemingly simple jobs opened the doors to the vast possibilities of a designer in the early crypto industry, igniting my passion for exploring the frontiers of blockchain technology.

Teaming up with Bill Drummond, we collaborated on his final project, "King of the Hill," an earnest effort that reflected our shared passion for innovation.
