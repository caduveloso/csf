Comusic is my most ambitious project, born from a profound love for music and cutting-edge technology. Nearly five years ago, the idea of a collaborative space for musicians to share, contribute, and co-create took root in my mind. With the advent of blockchain technology, I found the perfect avenue to turn this vision into a reality.

Motivated to improve my JavaScript skills and dive into React, I set out to create a groundbreaking music platform.

Starting from scratch, I diligently crafted Comusic, shaping it to resemble a simple digital audio workstation. Along the way, I mastered the intricacies of creating a robust audio player capable of playing multiple tracks simultaneously, with pan and volume controls.

Teaming up with local musicians, I created a live prototype and delved into using an SQL database to ensure the site's functionality. Choosing to build the foundation with a regular database, leaving room for seamless integration of blockchain capabilities in the future.

Comusic has grown into a collective of like-minded artists, nurturing and supporting emerging musicians in the Web3 space. Our roadmap includes exciting prospects like a marketplace for music NFTs and a service platform for music-related needs. The journey continues!
