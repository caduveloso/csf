In a curious twist of fate, my team and I took on a thrilling adventure â€“ designing an interface, logo, and website for a DeFi protocol. But alas, our payment vanished into thin air, just like the mysterious client who commissioned the project. Despite the unexpected outcome, we treasure the experience as a valuable lesson in the ever-exciting world of crypto.
