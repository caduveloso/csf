As I delved deeper into the development of Comusic, my passion for blockchain technology ignited a desire to explore more profound possibilities. I set out on a journey to familiarize myself with Solidity, the programming language of smart contracts, to create and deploy contracts on the blockchain.

During my first sprint, I dedicated time to grasp the fundamentals of token creation. Through self-education and hands-on experience with OpenZeppelin and similar libraries.

I learned how to create tokens and deploy them on Pulsechain's testnet and mainnet. I also explored liquidity provision on PulseX and worked to ensure the security of the meme coin I created for trading.

Later, I was able to create more complex smart contracts, including a Staking contract. This experience allowed me to learn tools like Truffle and Remix.
